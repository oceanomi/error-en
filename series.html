Knitting is a hobby a friend taught me in one afternoon in Istanbul. I never got beyond rectangular shapes and two types of stitches. The only useful things I can knit are scarves, but very amateur ones: full of asymmetries and love. But then I started to see them as unique and unrepeatable pieces marked by distractions and omissions, and embraced my imperfections.
<br>
<br>
Then I started to knit like crazy. No longer scarves but forms created from an impatient desire. I sought greatness in the details, incompleteness as a rule, all to reach impermanence, like wool, threads, wires; as hands weaving; as the head that puts names; as the eyes looking at the trees outside; as all that dies in the end. And so came ERROR, an exercise in accepting mortality. A Penelope of so-called middle age: knitting (in) the present; without waiting for anything or anyone.

My training and years of work in journalism have taught me to try different things: I've been a war correspondent, written a book, edited blogs, attempted a screenplay, worked in the humanitarian field, and made a documentary in Iraq. And now a venture into a new field. The textile experience brings me back to the present, gives me a break from futurism, I breathe and knit. I think we should all stop and try it for a while. To knit in peace.
