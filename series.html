    title: Mortal. Imperfect. With doubts.
    description: |
      The needle goes under and not over. It should then turn right but sometimes forgets. It hits the other needle, pulling a little wool into opposition territory, like a fight. The transfer of material sometimes comes with a metallic sound, but mostly it's quiet and steady. This repetitive rhythm, like the tide. Searching inwards for the mistake that gives an answer to the world outside.

      Go to the bottom to find something. Return from there if necessary. Show yourself: as I am now revealing myself to you. Undress, which is not the same as revealing yourself. Walk through the city in circles. Be hot and thirsty and head for the desert. Swim in a bathtub. Leave the soap in your eyes. Wake up at noon. Listen to the mosquitoes. Be someone's ghost. Take the shortest path. Don't say goodbye. Always be on time. Fear the light. Don't have children. Have them. Let the moon take over. Exit the tunnel. Read maps. Feel 10,000 kilometers away. Fall asleep in the sea. Look up. Get ready to tell the truth.
